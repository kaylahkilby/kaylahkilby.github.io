<H1> Growing Up In A Small Town </H1>

<P>
	I grew up in a small town most people don't know exists, called Eastport, Maine. It's a very small
close-knit arts community. In tragedy, we all come together to let people know they have our 
shoulders to lean on. In happiness, we all celebrate and rejoice to let people know how
much they mean to us. In sadness, we cheer people up to let them know things will get better. 
Through all the small (and big!) moments in our life, we have a whole community to share them 
with. 
</P>

	The local high school is a Class D school called Shead, with a student population of about 
100. I graduated with about 30 other people, knowing each one of them personally. Some 
of them life-long friends, others "new" friends from neighboring towns. In fact, most of the
kids I went to school with I have known my whole life. If I didn't know them chances were we
played middle school sports against each other, and we would soon play on the same team. During 
my time at Shead I played soccer, softball, and tennis. Managing both junior varsity boy's basketball, 
and varsity girl's basketball. NORTHERN MAINE CHAMPS BABY!!

	My grandparents lived right down the street from me, my dad living only a short walk of 
about 5-10 minutes. Any place I needed to be was within walking distance, and if it wasn't 
it was only a short drive away. Unlike in the cities, we only had 1 grocery store, and unless
it's summer only 2 restaurants to eat at. I guess you could say our choices were limited! 
Nonetheless, the food offered at our local restaurants are still delicious! Sadly, most of the
shops close during the winter, too. Until recently, the bakery was only open during "tourist season".
</P>

Speaking of tourist season.. Something me and my family look forward to every year is the annual 
4-day Fourth of July celebration our town throws. We get to reunite with family and friends that 
live far away. The town is decorated with flags, we have food vendors, and vendors selling 
collectibles, toys, and clothing, the annual Fourth of July parade and fireworks display. The town is
PACKED! Many people come to visit our little town as a tradition. Bringing their family, and friends
along with them. It's a great opportunity for "outsiders" to experience everything our little town
has to offer. 
</P>

	Once tourist season is over, our quiet little town goes back to how it was before, quiet..
And unless you played sports to keep you busy, there really wasn't much else to do. Options were
quite limited. I spent most of my time hanging out with family and friends, walking around town, 
riding down the backroads with friends, and every once in awhile when my dad was home from work he would
take me and my sister up to the softball field and let us get a few hits in. We'd also wake up early in the
morning before school, go down to "Grammy B's Beach" to look for sea glass, and watch the sun rise.
Something I wish I was able to do now, but my college and work schedule keep me pretty busy.

	I could go on and tell you about the cons of living in a small town. But that wouldn't be fair.  
I love my little town. I love my parents for giving me a chance to grow up in a place like that. 
I love all the friends it has given to me. I love the smell of the salt water when I come home from
a long trip. I love the smell of the clam flats, call me crazy. I love knowing when I go back home
it feels like I never left. I love the big, gigantic, support system it has left me with.
I love all the life lessons it has taught me. I love all the memories it has left me with.  
There's just something about growing up in a small town that makes everything you go through
growing up worth it. Eastport, I love you, thank you for everything.
